# Interger_CaLCULATOR
This project has been completed in Honors Data Structure Class in C++
The purpose of this project is to Implement a class LargeInt that will use the doubly linked list to store the individual digits of an integer, 
and will provide some basic I/O and arithmetic/logic operations that can be performed on integers.  
The implementation of the LargeInt type is encapsulated as a C++ class, aggregating a list object for the internal representation of the large integer value.
